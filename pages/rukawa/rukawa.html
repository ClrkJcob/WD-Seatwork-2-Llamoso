        <h2>The Cold-Blooded Ace</h2>
        <p>
  Kaede Rukawa is Shohoku’s stoic and prodigious scoring machine. With raw talent, unmatched athleticism, and an icy demeanor, he often dominates opponents with effortless drives and smooth jumpers. Rukawa is fiercely competitive and has one goal: to become the best basketball player in Japan. Though he rarely speaks and keeps others at a distance, his quiet intensity and work ethic speak volumes. His rivalry with other top players — and his dynamic tension with Sakuragi pushes him to evolve into not just a scorer, but a complete player. Underneath his cold exterior lies a relentless hunger for greatness.
